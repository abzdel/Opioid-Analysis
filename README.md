# Estimating the Impact of Opioid Control Policies

Opioid usage in the United States has increased substantially over the past two decades, leading
to an increase in addiction to both prescription opioids and non-prescription illegal opioids. This
has necessitated the enforcement of various opioid control policies. The White Houseâ€™s Office of
National Drug Control Policy and the federal agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Agency
(DEA) and the Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) have made efforts to combat
this national crisis. Across various parts of the US, state-level opioid control policies have also
been implemented. My group and I analyzed the effectiveness of each policy to see how both opioid addiction & prescription rates were impacted.

# Findings

We have a [final report](https://github.com/abzdel/Opioid-Analysis/blob/main/30_results/Final_Reports.pdf) that goes over findings for each state. This includes both a technical report intended to be read by a statistician as well as a non-technical report meant to be read by a policymaker (both in the same document).

We also have a [PowerPoint presentation](https://github.com/abzdel/Opioid-Analysis/blob/main/30_results/Presentation_Opioid%20Control.pptx) going over our findings in a more succinct way. [Here is a link to our presentation](https://youtu.be/aUk078iBfKs) of the slides.
